## Define the economy
Population size: 2500 <br />
Mean income (in USD, thousands): 50 <br />
Standard deviation of income (in USD, thousands): 12.5<br />
The population wealth is initially normally distributed<br />



```julia
# Define population, N()
n_pop = 2_500; # Population size
n_iter = 5000; # Iteration of collision
```


```julia
# Distribution of income
Œº_income = 50_000; # Mean income
œÉ_income = 12_000; # Standard deviation of income
ùêÉ = Normal(Œº_income, œÉ_income)
```




    Normal{Float64}(Œº=50000.0, œÉ=12000.0)



In case of random proportional wealth redistribution, we use random uniform distribution


```julia
# Decider for selecting two agents to collide
ùêî = Uniform(1, n_pop)
```




    Uniform{Float64}(a=1.0, b=2500.0)



We test two scenarios, <br />
(1) Equal wealth redistribution: when the two agents meet, they pull their wealth and split equally (50%) <br />
(2) Random wealth split: when the two agents meet, they pull their wealth and random-uniformly split the wealth (0 - 100%)


```julia
# vector of initial income of individual
val_inc_ini = deepcopy(rand(ùêÉ, n_pop));
# Equal splits
val_inc_trc = zeros(n_pop, n_iter); # Trace the changes in distribuiton
val_inc_trc[:,1] = val_inc_ini; # the very first distributional look
# Uniform random split
val_inc_trc_rand = zeros(n_pop, n_iter); # Trace the changes in distribuiton
val_inc_trc_rand[:,1] = val_inc_ini; # the very first distributional look
```

Run the scenarios


```julia

# Agent collide-split economy: two agents meet at a time, their wealth is equally distributed

for iter ‚àà 2:n_iter
    # initialize the starting wealth distributio of the period
    val_inc_trc[:, iter] = val_inc_trc[:, (iter - 1)];
    # For each iteration, we select two agents who will collide
    agt_1, agt_2 = sample(1:n_pop, 2; replace = false)
    # collect their financial values
    val_inc_agt_1, val_inc_agt_2 = val_inc_trc[agt_1, iter], val_inc_trc[agt_2, iter];
    # divide up their wealth equally, and save
    val_inc_distributed = mean([val_inc_agt_1, val_inc_agt_2]);
    val_inc_trc[agt_1, iter] = val_inc_distributed;
    val_inc_trc[agt_2, iter] = val_inc_distributed;

    # Iteration 2 - uniform wealth redistribution, ranom split =========================
    # initialize the starting wealth distributio of the period
    val_inc_trc_rand[:, iter] = val_inc_trc_rand[:, (iter - 1)];
    # For each iteration, we select two agents who will collide
    agt_1, agt_2 = sample(1:n_pop, 2; replace = false)
    # collect their financial values
    total_wealth = val_inc_trc_rand[agt_1, iter] + val_inc_trc_rand[agt_2, iter];
    # How to split the wealth ..........................................................
    œÅ = rand(1)[1]; #proportion to be split`
    # Redistribute wealth
    #   because of randomization, no need for random in order,
    val_inc_agt_1, val_inc_agt_2 = total_wealth * œÅ, total_wealth * (1 - œÅ)
    val_inc_trc_rand[agt_1, iter] = val_inc_agt_1;
    val_inc_trc_rand[agt_2, iter] = val_inc_agt_2;
end
```

For the rule of equal split,

With more transactions, there will be more people with equal and leveled wealth. As the collision count goes ‚àû, the distribution will become narrower, centering to the mean value of the original wealth distribution. This exemplifies the first Central Limit Theorem (CLT).


```julia
println("Mean - true: $(Œº_income); std - true: $(œÉ_income)")
println("Mean: $(mean(val_inc_trc[:,end])); std: $(std(val_inc_trc[:,end]))")
@gif for i ‚àà 1:10:n_iter
    histogram(val_inc_trc[:,i], title = "Iteration: $(i)", xlims = (0,1e5))
end every 5
```

    Mean - true: 50000; std - true: 12000
    Mean: 50227.38157018873; std: 4273.63120049074

For the rule of random split,

With the probability/proportion of wage split being uniform, an agent has an unknown chance of walking out richer (poorer) than the other agent.

If we set up an expectation: (proportion of wealth to be taken from a pool) * (total wealth collected from the pool), we expect more will walk out with smaller amount of money, with total expected share being an average. There will be a very few who would start with largeer sums, and the larger share of the wealth will more likely to be kept by fewer people.



```julia
println("Mean - true: $(Œº_income); std - true: $(œÉ_income)")
println("Mean: $(mean(val_inc_trc_rand[:,end])); std: $(std(val_inc_trc_rand[:,end]))")
@gif for i ‚àà 1:10:n_iter
    histogram(val_inc_trc_rand[:,i], title = "Iteration: $(i)", xlims = (0,2e5))
end every 5
```

    Mean - true: 50000; std - true: 12000
    Mean: 50227.38157018873; std: 42845.770082342555
